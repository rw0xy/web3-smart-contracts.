# Web3 & Smart Contracts Portfolio

This repository showcases core logic, architectural patterns, and security-first development for Ethereum-based environments (EVM).

## 🚀 Featured Logic

### MetaCoin Ecosystem
A modular implementation of a custom token system that demonstrates:
- **Modern Solidity Standards:** Developed using version `^0.8.0` for improved safety and gas accounting.
- **Security-First Approach:** Implements `msg.sender` patterns to ensure secure ownership and prevent common authorization vulnerabilities (e.g., `tx.origin` exploits).
- **Library Integration:** Utilizes `ConvertLib.sol` to demonstrate modularity and the separation of concerns, reducing contract size and optimizing deployment costs.

## 🛠 Technical Stack
- **Languages:** Solidity (^0.8.0)
- **Environments:** EVM Compatible (Ethereum, Polygon, L2s)
- **Tooling:** Remix IDE, Hardhat/Foundry compatible logic.

## 🛡️ Engineering Excellence
This code reflects the technical discipline and security standards I maintain across my professional projects. My development process is currently being further refined through specialized studies in **Software Engineering and Cybersecurity at Harvard University (CS50)**.
